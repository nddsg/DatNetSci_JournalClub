Nov 6th|11 AM| iCENSA| PhD student Wenlei Xie, David Bindel, Al Demers, and Johannes Gehrke have won one of two Best Student Paper awards at KDD 2015 for their paper "Edge-Weighted Personalized PageRank: Breaking A Decade-Old Performance Barrier". Their algorithm outperforms existing methods for computing PageRank on general graphs when the edge weights are personalized by nearly five orders of magnitude.



 Efficient Algorithms for Public-Private Social Networks, co-authored by Googlers Ravi Kumar, Silvio Lattanzi, Vahab Mirrokni, former Googler intern Alessandro Epasto and research visitor Flavio Chierichetti, was awarded Best Research Paper. The inspiration for this paper comes from studying social networks and the importance of addressing privacy issues in analyzing such networks. | Sal Aguinaga

### Short term goal
Get the journal club started by building a student base and developing discussions that substantially benefits students.

### Long term goal
Build the JC to run during regular semesters and around topics or themes that overlap with different labs.  Grow both the number of discussion leaders and students that want to participate in the discussions.
